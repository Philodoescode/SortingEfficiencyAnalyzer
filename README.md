## Implemented Algorithms

### Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms
1. **Quick Sort**
   - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that uses partitioning to recursively sort the elements.
2. **Merge Sort**
   - A stable divide-and-conquer algorithm that merges sorted subarrays.
3. **Shell Sort**
   - An optimized version of insertion sort using gap sequences.
4. **Selection Sort**
   - A simple algorithm that selects the smallest element and places it in the correct position.
5. **Insertion Sort**
   - A simple algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time.
6. **Heap Sort**
   - A comparison-based sorting algorithm using a binary heap.
7. **Gnome Sort**
   - A simple sorting algorithm similar to insertion sort.
8. **Odd-Even Sort**
   - A parallel sorting algorithm that compares and swaps adjacent elements.
9. **Bubble Sort**
   - A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements.
10. **Cocktail Shaker Sort**
    - A bi-directional variant of bubble sort.

### Non-Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms
11. **Counting Sort**
    - A stable algorithm that sorts elements by counting occurrences.
12. **Bucket Sort**
    - A distribution-based algorithm that divides the array into buckets and sorts them individually.
13. **Radix Sort**
    - A non-comparison sorting algorithm that processes digits from least to most significant (LSD).
14. **Gravity Sort (Bead Sort)**
    - A natural sorting algorithm based on the physical process of beads falling.
